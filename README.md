<h2>ABOUT PROJECT</h2>
<p>Safe is an application for reporting violence against women and children, through Safe which can be accessed by all service units handling victims of violence against women and children at the national, provincial, and district/city levels in an up to date, real time and accurate manner, to overcome violence</p>

<p>We made a safe place for every woman who get harassment to report any kind of violance or harrassment they get without being judged. Instead we made a safe place for every woman to get support for problems they are faced.</p>
  
<p>We apply machine learning to filtering negative comment on the comment section so the violence survivor can share their thoughts and experience without getting worry of being judged
